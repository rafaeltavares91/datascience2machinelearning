For those unfamiliar with Ed Sheeran, Ed Sheeran is an english singer, songwriter and producer.

    "In the previous section we discovered that Ed Sheeran was the dominant artist of 2017. However, as a budding Data Analyst or Data Scientist, we should always maintain a healthy degree of skepticism towards our initial results. We should always ask additional questions to either validate, invalidate or better understand our results. Some additional questions we might ask:\n",

    "- What factors could be influencing our results?\n",
    "- Within these factors, which have the highest degree of influence on our results?\n",
    "- How could our initial approach bias our results?\n",

During winter time, we likely use the heater more. We're also more likely to use the internet during the daytime for work rather than 3am.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset often reflects changes with respect to time. For example, we might conclude that Ed Sheeran was the dominant artist of 2017. However, our results could be heavily influenced by spikes in one or two months:\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class 'str'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, our date is a string type. To answer our initial question, we'll need to extract the month out of our string. One way of doing this, would be to split this string into a list, extract the month string and convert the month to an int:\n",

    "date = [int(d) for d in date]\n",
    "day = date[-1]\n",

    "\n",
    "Rather than extract the month manually, we can use the datetime module. The [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times. We'll learn about classes in the next mission. For now, think of classes as a bundle of methods and objects used for a specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datetime module contains the following classes:\n",

    "- **time** - Represents time of day. To import:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "from datetime import time\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from datetime import date\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **datetime** - Represents month, day, dayofweek, year etc. Combines both **time** class and **date** class. To import:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **timedelta** - Represents duration of time, difference between two dates. To import:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from datetime import timedelta\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the **datetime** class encapsulates both **time** and **date**, we'll be using the **datetime** class in this lesson. The methods of the **datetime** class and **time**, **date** classes are generally very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning back to our over-arching questions, **Who is the dominant artist for each month of the year?** , we could use the **datetime** class to extract the **month** out from our dates. But before we extract the month from our dates, we'll need to understand how to use a datetime object. A **datetime** object represents a single point in time.
