    "## Motivating Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You may realize that parsing this file was not different than parsing any other file from the previous missions. You may also realize that we rarely rewrite the same code twice; instead, we use a method that allows us to reuse code, **functions** such as **print()**, **type()**, **open()**, etc. Now, we formally define functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen before, a function is a packaged body of code that we can reuse by **calling** with the relevant parameters. The parameters that a function takes are called the **inputs** of the function, and the result that it returns is called the **output**. For example, we called the **open()** function with two inputs (the strings **\"movie_metadata.csv\"** and **\"r\"**), and received the output which is a **wrapper** for the file **movie_metadata.csv.** All functions follow the same road map as **open()**: They take in **input(s)**, execute the code that they surround, and return an **output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because functions are **reusable**, we can package all the parsing we just did into one function. Then, we can call the function whenever we need to parse a file instead of having to rewrite the necessary code every time. We have been making extensive use of functions, so this should not be unfamiliar. If we had a **parser()** function, the code for the last instructions would be as concise as this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> movie_data = parser(movie_metadata)\n",
    ">>> print(movie_data[0:5])\n",
    "[['movie_title', 'director_name', 'color', 'duration', 'actor_1_name', 'language', 'country', 'title_year'], ['Avatar', 'James Cameron', 'Color', '178', 'CCH Pounder', 'English', 'USA', '2009'], [\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\", 'Gore Verbinski', 'Color', '169', 'Johnny Depp', 'English', 'USA', '2007'], ['Spectre', 'Sam Mendes', 'Color', '148', 'Christoph Waltz', 'English', 'UK', '2015'], ['The Dark Knight Rises', 'Christopher Nolan', 'Color', '164', 'Tom Hardy', 'English', 'USA', '2012']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than reusability, there are **3 main advantages of using functions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They allow us to use other people's code without the necessity to have a deep understanding of how it was written (e.g., we use the **print()** function without reading the code inside it). We call this information hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They **break down complex logic** into smaller components or modules. Instead of writing very lengthy and complicated code, we can progress function by function. For example, if we were writing a larger piece of code, **parser()** as a function would be easier to manage rather than the code that executes the same behavior. This would make testing easier as well. We refer to this as **modularity**, which is especially important when working on teams. **Modularity makes it easier for someone else to read, understand, use, and build upon our code.**\n",
    "- They streamline our code and make it easier **to maintain**. Programmers reuse the same functions in multiple situations across a project. This means that they generalize the function as much as possible to maximize its usefulness. we call this **process abstraction**, which is an important part of reducing our code's complexity, especially for larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the usefulness of functions, let's see how we can write our own functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, we used **built-in** functions: **functions that Python has defined for us**. However, our toolbox is not limited to this; we can write our own functions. The syntax for defining a function consists of 5 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **def keyword** - For Python to interpret the following code as a function\n",
    "- **Name** - To refer to when we need to call the function later\n",
    "- **Arguments** - Input value(s) that the function takes in\n",
    "- **Body** - The code that the function executes\n",
    "- **Return value** - The value that the function returns to the user when the function terminates\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us examine the syntax further, using an example function that returns the first element of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def first_elt(input_lst):\n",
    "    first = input_lst[0]\n",
    "    return first\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We start the function definition with the keyword **def**. We give the function a name that explains its use, in this case: **first_elt()**. Then, we name the single argument that the function takes. Here, we name the argument **input_lst**, suggesting to the user that the function must take in a list as input. In the next line, we define the body of the function, which consists of only one line in our case. This is the actual code that will be executed when the function is called. Finally, we use the keyword **\"return\"** to signify the end of the function, and type the variable that we want returned to the user, in this case, **first**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we should take note of the **indentation** of the function. Realize that after the colon, we indent the remainder of the function by one **tab**, which is the equivalent of **4 space bar strokes**. This is to clarify to Python what part of the code belongs to the function. Therefore, indentation makes functional differences in Python's interpretation of the code. You may notice that if you format the first line of the function correctly, so that Python recognizes that the next line will be the beginning of the function body, it indents the next line by 1 tab automatically. To make this behavior clear, you can see the diagram below and try for yourself. Notice that we do not need to press tab or space bar; Python automatically puts the indentation when we press enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1AV7PYW5SrQUPClQwskn_81dqemm9r8aN\">\n",
    "\n",
    "One other thing to note is that **first** and **input_lst** are temporary variables, which means that they are only accessible inside the function. If you attempt to use first somewhere else in the code outside the function, you will get an error saying that first is undefined. For example, observe the example below:\n",

    "\n",
    "This error occurs because first does not have a defined value outside of the **first_elt()** function. Then, in order to access the return value of this function, we set it equal to a variable, so the variable gets the function's return value. Here is the fix:\n",

    "However, you can see that this function is almost the same with **is_usa()**, except for the string they check for. This can give us the intuition that there is another layer of abstraction we can perform. If we could write a function that takes in two inputs, namely, the list and the string to check for, we could eliminate the inefficiency of writing the same code twice. Fortunately, we can exactly do that:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the beginning of the section, we observed that the first row of **movie_metadata** is not an element of the data itself, but is a list of the attributes that defines that data. Although this is useful, there is no need for this row to be a part of our **movie_data**, and can actually cause misinformation. Let's say we want to count the number of movies in the list. Our intuition might be to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def naive_counter(input_lst):\n",
    "    num_elt = 0\n",
    "    for each in input_lst:\n",
    "        num_elt = num_elt + 1\n",

    ">>> print(naive_counter(movie_data))\n",
    "4933\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the first item in the list is also counted by the counter. Of course, we can get around this by subtracting one from the result, but manipulating the function that way would cause it to be unusable in cases where there is no header row. This is not generalizable, so it is not a neat solution. Instead, we can use an argument that has a default value that can be manipulated, we call this an **optional argument**. Optional arguments have default values that they take on unless a different value is provided by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the default value for an argument that determines whether or not there is a header row would be **False**, because most datasets do not have header rows. However, when we encounter a dataset like this one, we can call the counter by explicitly telling it that there is a header row. Let's modify the function to have this behavior by adding an optional parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def counter(input_lst,header_row = False):\n",
    "    num_elt = 0\n",

    "        input_lst = input_lst[1:len(input_lst)]\n",
    "    for each in input_lst:\n",
    "        num_elt = num_elt + 1\n",
    "    return num_elt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the function will behave as we expected:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(counter(movie_data))\n",
    "4933\n",
    ">>> print(counter(movie_data, True))\n",

    ">>> print(counter(movie_data, header_row = True))\n",
    "4932\n",
    "```\n",

However, we would like **summary_statistics()** to be a function itself, and re-writing all of the code inside **feature_counter()** in **summary_statistics()** defies the purpose of using a function. You may remember that one of the big advantages of using a function is **abstraction**: the fact that it saves us from having to write the same code twice. In this vein, the last feature of functions that we will use is the ability to call a function inside another function.\n",

We have already seen this, because comparison operators such as the equality operator (** == ** ) and arithmetic operations such as sum  (**+** ) and minus (**-**) are functions as well. Similarly, we can call built-in or user-created functions by making their return values equal to a variable in the outer function, so that we can use that variable in the function.\n",

If the interpreter encounters any code that doesn't adhere to Python's language rules, it halts the parsing and returns an error. Rich coding environments like [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Jupyter Notebook ](https://jupyter.org/) help us prevent these types of errors through syntax highlighting - a feature that displays different parts of our code (such as brackets) in different colors. Syntax highlighting makes it easier to read our code and spot errors. Some examples of syntax errors include:\n",
