We use clustering when we're trying to explore a dataset, and understand the connections between the various rows and columns. For example, we can cluster NBA players based on their statistics.

Earlier, we computed a **senator_distances** array that shows the distance from each Senator to the center of each cluster. We can treat these distances as x and y coordinates, and make a scatterplot that shows the position of each Senator. This works because the distances are relative to the cluster centers.\n",

If we left the distances as is, we'd end up with 3.4 + .24 = 3.64, and 2.6 + 2 = 4.6, which would make the moderate, who is between both parties, seem extreme.

    "**Point guards** play one of the most crucial roles on a team because their **primary responsibility is to create scoring opportunities** for the team. We are going to focus our lesson on a machine learning technique called **clustering**, which allows us to visualize the types of point guards as well as group similar point guards together. **Using 2 features** allows us to easily visualize the players and will also make it easier to grasp how clustering works. For point guards, it's widely accepted that the **Assist to Turnover Ratio** is a good indicator for performance in games as it quantifies the number of scoring opportunities that player created. Let's also use **Points Per Game**, since effective Point Guards not only set up scoring opportunities but also take a lot of the shots themselves\n",

    "In this lesson, we explored how to segment NBA players into groups with similar traits. Our exploration helped us get a sense of the 5 types of point guards as based on each player's Assist Turnover Ratio and Points Per Game. In future challenges, you can explore how to cluster using many more features, as well as alternative ways of clustering data without using centroids.\n",
